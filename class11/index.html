				<section data-state="DMC2018">
					<ul>Well, the people who stay here ... the elderly, because they are rooted here; they already have their assets, whether they are good or bad. And well, because of age, they cannot be hired anywhere. It is also safer for them to live in the village, because they know everyone here. They know who they can lean on.</ul>
					<p>--Isabel, 47 year‐old female</p>
				</section>

				<section data-state="DMC2018">
					<ul>Sometimes it looks like some of those who migrated maybe never truly decided to migrate. It is very complex. Or maybe many of us who had stayed put, would have liked to migrate but we did not. When villagers for instance have no land, not a single plot, have no house, I think it is easier for them to leave. Because otherwise they have nothing here, although they have their memories here, their ancestors; they have everything else here but they need to feed their bodies, so they decide to leave and try to better [andar consiguiendo]. In that case, yes, it is easier for them to leave. Even though it is a very hard thing to do.</ul>
					<p>--Emiliano, 47 year-old male</p>
				</section>

				<section data-state="DMC2018">
				<ul>Lupe, do you think it is simpler to stay put or to migrate?
[She doubts ...] Well, it's ... if you have a job here, I say it's good here. But then there are people that look like they do not like to work, or they do not work enough, and therefore for them it is better to go. But leaving, I would not want to leave, who knows why others leave? But not me, I tell you, I would not like it. And
now, even less.</ul>
<p>--Lupe, 37 year-old female</p>
</section>

<section data-state="DMC2018">
	<ul>
‐Why did you decide to go?
Because unfortunately the countryside in Mexico is neglected. The government does not support it. It is not as supportive as other countries are. So we cannot get ahead from working in the fields as much as we would like to. Or at least as much as other people can with their jobs. So, I needed to have my own stuff, and I didn't find other way than going to the other side [to the US].
‐When you say your stuff ...
My fields, my house, my car. What everyone aims to have, isn't it? A home. Something to move around. To live more comfortably.
</ul>
<p>--Julio, 31 year-old male</p>

<section data-state="DMC2018">
	<ul>
Migrating elsewhere, even within Mexico, to another state, is difficult. You have to learn other ways of doing things, different food, the language in the United States ... It is always difficult to go elsewhere, it is not like being in one's place.</ul>
<p>Agustín, 47 year-old male</p>
</section>

<section data-state="DMC2018">
	<ul>
Well I'm adaptable. I like it here. I like it anywhere. It does not affect me. It has not affected me in the places I have live in. I am ... happy. So, no, I don't mind being here, or anywhere else, but now my old mom needs me here. And I can do it [take care of her]. See, I am restless. I like it here, but if the opportunity of going to Tampico [a Mexican city] arises to take care of a friend who needs care, I would go. They call me a wanderer [laughs].</ul>
